<p><b>ABOUT : </b><br><br>
Dhass ka dhum is an event with fun oriented Mathematical Games. It need not be conceptually intricate to involve deeper computational underpinnings. This event differs sharply from Mathematical quiz in that Mathematical quiz requires specific mathematical expertise to complete, whereas it does not require a deep knowledge of Mathematics to play. They are of deep interest in the field of recreational Mathematics. These games have simple rules and match procedures with logic and recreation. If you and your team think that you deserve the honour, then this is your opportunity. Come and grab it! </b><br>
